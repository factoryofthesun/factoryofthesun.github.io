I am a 4th year PhD student in the [3DL lab](https://threedle.cs.uchicago.edu/) at UChicago advised by [Rana Hanocka](https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~ranahanocka/).
My research is on applied AI for geometry processing and 2D priors for 3D understanding/synthesis.
I am also interested in general applications of AI to science and scientific discovery.
