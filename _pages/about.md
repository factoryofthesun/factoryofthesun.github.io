I am a 4th year PhD student in the [3DL lab](https://threedle.cs.uchicago.edu/) at UChicago advised by [Rana Hanocka](https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~ranahanocka/) My primary research interests are in applied deep learning to geometry processing and computer graphics, but I am interested in general applications of deep learning to science.
